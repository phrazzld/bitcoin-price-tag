# Error Handling Strategy

This document outlines the error handling approach for the Bitcoin Price Tag Chrome extension.

## Content Script Price Fetch Failures

### Decision: Silent Logging

The extension uses a **silent logging approach** for handling price fetch failures in content scripts. This means:

- No visual error indicators are shown to users
- All errors are logged using structured logging for debugging
- The page continues to function normally without price annotations

### Rationale

1. **User Experience First**: Users should not be interrupted by error messages while browsing. The extension's failure to fetch price data should not impact the normal browsing experience.

2. **Graceful Degradation**: When price data cannot be fetched, the page simply displays without bitcoin price annotations. This is the least intrusive failure mode.

3. **Developer Observability**: All errors are logged with appropriate context using our structured logging system, ensuring developers can debug issues without impacting users.

4. **Consistent with Browser Extension Best Practices**: Chrome extensions should be unobtrusive and helpful, not sources of error notifications.

### Implementation Details

The content script (`src/content-script/index.ts`) implements this approach:

```typescript
try {
  const priceData = await requestPriceData();
  findAndAnnotatePrices(document.body, priceData);
} catch (error) {
  // Log errors silently without user notification
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    if (error.name === 'PriceRequestTimeoutError') {
      logger.error('Request timed out', error, {
        function_name: 'initPriceAnnotation'
      });
    } else if (error.name === 'PriceRequestError') {
      logger.error('Request failed', error, {
        function_name: 'initPriceAnnotation'
      });
    } else {
      logger.error('Unexpected error', error, {
        function_name: 'initPriceAnnotation'
      });
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Types and Handling

1. **PriceRequestTimeoutError**: Logged when the request to the service worker times out
2. **PriceRequestError**: Logged when the service worker returns an error response
3. **Unexpected Errors**: Any other errors are logged as unexpected

All errors include:
- Error message and stack trace
- Function context
- Correlation IDs when available

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Visual Error Indicators**: Showing error badges or notifications was rejected as too intrusive for a browsing enhancement extension.

2. **Partial Annotations**: Annotating prices with cached data even when fresh data fails was considered but rejected to maintain data accuracy.

3. **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retries were deemed unnecessary as pages are frequently refreshed during normal browsing.

## Service Worker Error Handling

The service worker implements a more sophisticated error handling strategy with retries and fallbacks, as it operates in the background without direct user interaction.

See `src/service-worker/api.ts` for the implementation of exponential backoff and retry logic for API failures.

## Testing Error Scenarios

Error handling can be tested by:
1. Disabling network connectivity
2. Blocking the CoinDesk API domain
3. Simulating service worker failures
4. Using browser developer tools to throttle network speed

## Future Considerations

- Monitor error rates through logging aggregation
- Consider implementing circuit breakers if API failures become frequent
- Evaluate user feedback to determine if the silent failure approach remains optimal
