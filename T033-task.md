## Title: test service worker restart scenarios for state persistence

## Original Ticket Text:
- [ ] **T033 · Test · P2: test service worker restart scenarios for state persistence**
    - **Context:** Risk Matrix - Service Worker Lifecycle Unpredictability
    - **Action:**
        1. Manually or programmatically (if test framework allows) force service worker restarts.
        2. Verify that state persisted in `chrome.storage.local` is correctly reloaded/used.
        3. Verify that alarms persist and trigger correctly after restart.
    - **Done-when:**
        1. Service worker correctly recovers state and alarm functionality after restarts.
    - **Verification:**
        1. Observe logs and extension behavior after SW restarts.
    - **Depends-on:** [T015, T017, T019, T026]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

I need to test service worker restart scenarios to ensure state persistence. This is critical for the Bitcoin Price Tag extension's reliability. Please analyze this task considering:

1. Testing Philosophy constraints (especially no mocking of internal modules)
2. Service worker lifecycle management in Chrome extensions
3. State persistence through chrome.storage.local
4. Alarm persistence across restarts
5. Test isolation and reproducibility
6. Integration with existing test framework (Vitest)

Key Questions:
- How can we programmatically force service worker restarts?
- What are the key scenarios to test?
- How do we ensure test isolation when dealing with persistent storage?
- What's the best approach to verify alarm functionality?
- How can we make these tests reliable and not flaky?

Context:
- We're using Manifest V3
- Service workers can be evicted at any time by the browser
- State must persist in chrome.storage.local
- Alarms should survive service worker restarts
- We already have unit tests for cache.ts and service worker handlers

Please provide a comprehensive testing approach that:
1. Identifies all critical scenarios to test
2. Suggests implementation strategies for each scenario
3. Ensures test reliability and isolation
4. Follows our development philosophy
5. Integrates with our existing test infrastructure
