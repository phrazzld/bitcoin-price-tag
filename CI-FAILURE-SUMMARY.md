# CI Failure Summary

**Run ID:** 15451493386  
**PR:** #26 - feat: implement robust content script initialization with DOM observation  
**Branch:** robust-content-script-initialization  
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-04T19:57:19Z  
**Duration:** ~6 minutes  

## Failure Overview

**ALL CI jobs failed** due to a fundamental configuration mismatch between GitHub Actions workflow and project package manager.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Package Manager Configuration Mismatch

**Error:** `Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/bitcoin-price-tag/bitcoin-price-tag. Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock`

**Root Cause:** GitHub Actions workflow is configured to use npm caching, but the project uses pnpm with `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

### Specific Configuration Problems

1. **GitHub Actions Setup Node.js step:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Setup Node.js
     uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: '20'
       cache: 'npm'  # ❌ WRONG: Should be 'pnpm'
   ```

2. **Expected vs Actual Lock Files:**
   - **Expected by workflow:** `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock`
   - **Actual in project:** `pnpm-lock.yaml`

3. **Package Manager Declaration:**
   - **package.json specifies:** `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.10.0"`
   - **Workflow assumes:** npm

## Failed Jobs Detail

| Job | Status | Duration | Primary Error |
|-----|--------|----------|---------------|
| Type Check | ❌ Failed | 7s | Dependencies lock file not found |
| Test (18) | ❌ Failed | 8s | Dependencies lock file not found |  
| Test (20) | ❌ Failed | 8s | Dependencies lock file not found |
| Build | ❌ Failed | 5s | Dependencies lock file not found |
| Lint | ❌ Failed | 5s | Dependencies lock file not found |
| CI Success | ❌ Failed | 2s | All dependent jobs failed |

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** BLOCKER - No CI job can complete
- **Scope:** Entire CI pipeline non-functional
- **Root Problem:** Workflow-project mismatch, not code quality issues
- **Urgency:** HIGH - Blocks all PR merges and quality enforcement

## Secondary Issues (Currently Masked)

Due to the primary configuration failure, secondary issues may exist but are not visible:
- Potential linting errors
- Potential type checking errors  
- Potential test failures
- Potential build issues

These will only be discoverable after fixing the primary configuration issue.

## Environment Details

- **Runner:** ubuntu-24.04 (Version: 20250511.1.0)
- **Node.js:** v20.19.1 (from actions/setup-node@v4)
- **npm:** 10.8.2 (installed but not used)
- **Expected pnpm:** 10.10.0 (from package.json, but setup step fails before pnpm installation)

## Commit Context

The failure appears on commit: `171251b5456eac771cd6355e8a83b405394f634b`
This suggests recent changes may have updated pnpm configuration but CI wasn't updated accordingly.
