# T028: Comprehensive Testing and Verification on Amazon Pages

## Task Description

Perform thorough manual and automated (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) testing across a variety of Amazon pages (product, cart, search, pages with known iframes). Verify:
1. No crashes or blank pages occur
2. Extension functionality works as expected in supported contexts 
3. Graceful degradation or early exit occurs in restricted contexts
4. Console errors related to context, callbacks, bridge, and DOM processing are eliminated

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Test Environment Setup

1. Ensure Playwright is properly configured for browser extension testing
   - Verify playwright.config.js has proper extension loading settings
   - Set up browser contexts with the extension installed
   - Configure logging capture and diagnostic mode

2. Create diagnostic mode utilities
   - Implement a test helper that enables diagnostic mode for enhanced logging
   - Set up log capture and analysis utilities
   - Create snapshot comparison tools for extension states

### 2. Test Case Design

1. Identify key Amazon page types to test:
   - Product pages (single product with price)
   - Search results pages (multiple products/prices)
   - Cart pages (subtotals, quantity adjustments)
   - Checkout pages (restricted context expected)
   - Category browsing pages
   - Pages with iframes (product reviews, recommendations)

2. For each page type, design test cases for:
   - Normal operation (price conversion works correctly)
   - Restricted contexts (graceful degradation)
   - Error handling (simulated API failures)
   - Performance aspects (no freezing/blocking)

### 3. Automated Test Implementation

1. Create base test utilities and helpers:
   - Extension installation and configuration helpers
   - Page navigation utilities for Amazon
   - DOM inspection utilities for price elements
   - Log capture and verification utilities
   - Context simulation utilities (restricted iframe simulation)

2. Implement product page tests:
   - Verify price conversion on standard product pages
   - Test various price formats and currencies
   - Verify proper WeakSet usage with multiple price elements

3. Implement search results page tests:
   - Verify all prices on search results are converted
   - Test pagination and dynamic content loading
   - Verify handling of mixed content types

4. Implement cart/checkout flow tests:
   - Test conversion of cart totals
   - Verify behavior in checkout restricted contexts
   - Test quantity adjustment price updates

5. Implement error condition tests:
   - Simulate API failures and verify fallback mechanisms
   - Test with simulated restricted contexts
   - Verify console error handling and suppression

### 4. Manual Testing Checklist

1. Extension installation and activation:
   - Verify clean installation works
   - Verify updates don't break functionality

2. Visual verification across page types:
   - Product pages (desktop and mobile versions)
   - Search results with various layouts
   - Shopping cart and checkout pages
   - Third-party seller pages

3. Restricted context testing:
   - Secure checkout pages
   - Third-party iframes
   - Cross-origin embedded content

4. Error handling verification:
   - Offline mode testing
   - Slow network conditions
   - API failure simulation

### 5. Log Analysis Implementation

1. Create log analysis tools:
   - Log pattern matcher for error detection
   - Statistics on warning/error frequency
   - Context correlation analysis

2. Analyze logs from automated and manual tests:
   - Look for unexpected errors or warnings
   - Verify context detection is accurate
   - Confirm early exits occur only when appropriate
   - Verify correct correlation IDs across operations

### 6. Documentation and Reporting

1. Document test results:
   - Create detailed test reports for each page type
   - Document any remaining edge cases or limitations
   - Create regression test suite for future verification

2. Summarize improvements:
   - Compare error rates before and after fixes
   - Document context detection accuracy
   - Analyze performance metrics

## Testing Approach

The testing approach will combine:

1. **Automated testing** with Playwright for:
   - Functional verification (price conversion works)
   - Integration testing (all modules work together)
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Manual testing** for:
   - Visual verification of price conversions
   - User experience validation
   - Edge case handling in real-world scenarios

3. **Log analysis** for:
   - Verification of error handling
   - Context detection accuracy
   - Correlation ID propagation
   - Decision point validation

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All automated tests pass consistently across multiple runs
2. Manual testing verifies correct visual behavior on all tested page types
3. No unexpected console errors occur in normal operation
4. Log analysis confirms proper context-aware behavior and error handling
5. Clean, expected early exits occur in restricted contexts without errors
6. The extension does not crash or cause page crashes in any tested scenario
