## Chosen Approach
Implement integration tests for service worker <-> content script communication using Vitest, mocking Chrome runtime messaging APIs while testing real internal collaborators.

## Rationale
- Follows testing strategy guidelines by focusing on integration tests
- Adheres to mocking policy by only mocking external Chrome APIs
- Maintains modularity by testing through public APIs
- Ensures testability without internal mocking
- Aligns with coding standards through Vitest framework usage

## Build Steps
1. Set up Vitest environment for integration testing
2. Create mock implementations for Chrome runtime messaging APIs
3. Write test suites for service worker <-> content script communication
4. Verify message passing between components through public APIs
5. Test various scenarios based on cache/API state
6. Achieve >80% coverage through comprehensive test cases
7. Integrate tests into CI pipeline with coverage enforcement
