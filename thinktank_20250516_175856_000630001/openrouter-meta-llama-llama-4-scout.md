## Chosen Approach

Write integration tests for service worker <-> content script communication, focusing on message passing and error handling.

## Rationale

- We need to ensure reliable communication between the service worker and content script.
- Integration tests will verify the correctness of message passing and error handling.

## Build Steps

1. **Set up test environment**: Configure Vitest and necessary dependencies.
2. **Mock Chrome runtime APIs**: Use a mocking library to simulate Chrome runtime messaging APIs.
3. **Simulate message passing**: Test sending and receiving messages between service worker and content script.
4. **Verify responses**: Assert that responses are correct based on mock cache/API state.
5. **Test error cases**: Verify error handling for message passing.

## Test Architecture Design

### Test Organization

- Create a test file for integration tests (e.g., `integration.test.ts`).
- Organize tests into suites for service worker and content script communication.

### Test Coverage Strategy

- **Happy path tests**: Verify successful message passing.
- **Error cases and edge cases**: Test error handling and boundary conditions.

### Mocking Strategy

- Mock Chrome runtime messaging APIs (e.g., `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `onMessage` listeners).
- Use a mocking library to simulate message passing.

### Implementation Details

- Use Vitest as the testing framework.
- Leverage a mocking library (e.g., `vi.mock`) to mock Chrome APIs.

## Code Organization

- Place test files in a `tests/integration` directory.
- Use a consistent naming convention for test files and functions.

## Technical Challenges

- Handling async messaging patterns.
- Simulating service worker lifecycle.

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage > 80%.
- Test execution time considerations.
- Maintainability factors.
