# T025: Harden Messaging Bridge Availability Checks and Fallbacks

## Current Understanding
The messaging bridge is a critical component that enables communication between different parts of the extension (content scripts, background script, etc.). In restricted environments like Amazon iframes, the bridge may be unavailable or compromised, leading to crashes.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Identify Bridge Usage
- Locate all files that utilize the messaging bridge
- Focus on the core bridge implementation and its consumer code

### 2. Enhance Bridge Availability Detection
- Implement robust checks for bridge availability before any usage
- Create a reusable function to test bridge integrity

### 3. Implement Fallback Mechanisms
- Define clear fallback behaviors when the bridge is unavailable
- Ensure graceful degradation of functionality
- Return appropriate default values/error objects

### 4. Leverage Context Detection
- Use the context detection from T021 to conditionally enable/disable bridge functionality
- Add early-exit paths for restricted contexts

### 5. Add Detailed Logging
- Log bridge availability status and fallback activations
- Include context information in logs for easier debugging

## Files Likely to Change
- content-script.js (bridge implementation)
- content-module.js (bridge consumer)
- content.js (bridge consumer)
- background.js (message handler)
- Any other files using chrome.runtime.sendMessage

## Testing Strategy
- Verify bridge behavior in normal contexts
- Test fallback mechanisms in restricted contexts
- Ensure no uncaught exceptions when bridge is unavailable
