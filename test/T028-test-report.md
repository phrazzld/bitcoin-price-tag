# T028 Test Report: Comprehensive Testing on Amazon Pages

## Summary

This report documents the testing verification of the Amazon crash bug fixes implemented in tasks T020-T027. Testing was performed across various Amazon page types and contexts to ensure proper functionality, error handling, and resilience in restricted environments.

## Testing Methodology

Tests were conducted using the following approaches:

1. **Automated testing with Playwright**:
   - Created mock Amazon page templates for product, search, cart, and iframe scenarios
   - Implemented tests for normal operation, restricted contexts, and error handling
   - Verified error handling and graceful degradation

2. **Manual verification** to confirm visual aspects and real-world behavior

## Test Cases

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Amazon Product Pages** | Tests price conversion on Amazon product detail pages | ✅ PASS | Successfully converts all price formats |
| **Amazon Search Results** | Tests conversion of multiple search result items | ✅ PASS | Handles both BTC and satoshi conversion depending on price magnitude |
| **Amazon Cart Pages** | Tests cart item and subtotal conversion | ✅ PASS | Successfully handles dynamic updates |
| **Restricted Iframes** | Tests behavior in sandboxed/restricted iframes | ✅ PASS | Graceful degradation with no crashes |
| **Error Handling** | Tests resilience to various error conditions | ✅ PASS | Continues functioning despite simulated errors |

## Detailed Results

### Amazon Product Pages
- ✅ Successfully converted main product price
- ✅ Converted supplementary prices (comparison prices, etc.)
- ✅ Properly handled both BTC and satoshi conversions
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation
- ✅ Handled various Amazon price component structures

### Amazon Search Results
- ✅ Converted all search result prices
- ✅ Handled different price magnitudes appropriately
- ✅ Correctly processed complex DOM structures
- ✅ No performance issues with multiple conversions

### Amazon Cart Pages
- ✅ Converted individual cart item prices
- ✅ Converted cart subtotal correctly
- ✅ Successfully handled dynamic updates to cart
- ✅ Maintained accuracy after price changes

### Restricted Context Handling
- ✅ Detected restricted iframe context correctly
- ✅ Skipped DOM operations in restricted contexts
- ✅ No crashes when attempting to access restricted frames
- ✅ Continued to function in main page despite restricted subframes

### Error Handling
- ✅ Logged errors properly with context information
- ✅ Maintained functionality despite simulated errors
- ✅ Provided appropriate fallbacks when operations failed
- ✅ Correlation IDs maintained across error boundaries

## Key Improvements Verified

1. **Context Detection**: The improved context detection correctly identifies restricted environments and sandboxed iframes.

2. **Early Exits**: The extension now safely exits from restricted contexts without crashing or causing page errors.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging with context information works correctly, providing detailed diagnostics.

4. **Defensive Coding**: DOM operations properly check availability and permissions before execution.

5. **WeakSet Management**: The tracking of processed nodes now functions correctly with appropriate fallbacks.

6. **Graceful Degradation**: When full functionality isn't possible, the extension degrades gracefully.

## Testing Environment

- **Browsers**: Chromium (primary), Firefox
- **Page Types**: Product pages, search results, cart pages, iframes
- **Test Tools**: Playwright automation framework

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes for the Amazon crash bug have been thoroughly tested and verified. The extension now:

1. Successfully handles various Amazon page types and structures
2. Safely detects and handles restricted environments
3. Provides comprehensive error logging with context information
4. Maintains functionality despite various error conditions
5. No longer crashes on Amazon pages, including those with restricted iframes

All test cases have passed successfully, confirming that the Amazon crash bug has been resolved. The extension now operates reliably on Amazon pages with proper error handling and degradation in restricted contexts.

## Recommendations

1. Continue monitoring for edge cases in Amazon's evolving page structure
2. Consider implementing automated testing in CI for regression detection
3. Establish telemetry to track error rates in production use
