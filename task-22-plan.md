# Task 22: Optimize DOM Scanning Algorithm

## Overview
The current DOM scanning algorithm in content.js traverses the entire DOM tree to find currency values and convert them to Bitcoin equivalents. This process can be resource-intensive, especially on large web pages, potentially causing performance issues. The goal is to optimize this algorithm to make it more efficient.

## Current Implementation Analysis
Looking at the current implementation in content.js, the DOM traversal is done using a recursive `walk` function that:
1. Processes each node of the DOM tree
2. For elements, processes all child nodes recursively
3. For text nodes, applies currency conversion
4. Has special handling for Amazon price elements
5. Uses a MutationObserver to handle dynamically added content

## Optimization Approaches

### 1. Targeted Scanning
Instead of scanning the entire DOM, we can target specific elements that are more likely to contain prices:
- Elements with certain classes/ids (e.g., 'price', 'cost', 'amount')
- Elements within common containers (product listings, checkout pages)
- Use document.querySelectorAll for targeted selection

### 2. Tree Pruning
Skip subtrees that are unlikely to contain relevant content:
- Skip script, style, svg, and other non-content elements
- Skip hidden elements
- Skip previously processed elements

### 3. Lazy Processing
- Process nodes in batches
- Prioritize visible content (in viewport)
- Defer processing of off-screen content
- Use IntersectionObserver for viewport detection

### 4. Caching and Memoization
- Cache processed nodes to avoid re-processing
- Use a WeakMap to track processed nodes
- Memoize currency pattern matches

### 5. Algorithm Improvements
- Replace recursion with iteration where possible
- Use DocumentFragment for batch DOM operations
- Optimize regular expressions for currency patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create performance benchmarks**
   - Measure current performance on various page sizes
   - Create test pages with different DOM complexities
   - Establish baseline metrics (processing time, CPU usage)

2. **Implement Tree Pruning**
   - Add logic to skip irrelevant elements
   - Maintain a list of element tags to skip
   - Add data attribute to mark processed nodes

3. **Implement Targeted Scanning**
   - Create a list of selectors for price-like elements
   - Use more specific queries rather than walking the entire DOM
   - Combine with tree walking for completeness

4. **Implement Lazy Processing**
   - Add viewport detection using IntersectionObserver
   - Process visible elements immediately
   - Queue off-screen elements for later processing

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Compare optimized algorithm against benchmarks
   - Ensure accuracy is maintained
   - Test on various websites and DOM structures

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced CPU and memory usage
- Faster initial page load processing
- Improved responsiveness for dynamic content
- Maintained accuracy of price conversions
