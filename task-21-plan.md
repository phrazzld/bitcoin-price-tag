# Task 21: Create fallback mechanisms when API is unavailable

## Overview
This task requires implementing fallback mechanisms for when the Bitcoin price API is unavailable. Upon reviewing the codebase, I've found that the majority of this work has already been implemented as part of the previous error handling task. However, I'll enhance the existing fallback mechanisms to make them more robust and ensure they're working properly.

## Current Implementation
The current codebase already has several layers of fallback mechanisms:

1. Primary API (CoinDesk) with retry logic
2. Alternative APIs (Blockchain.info, CoinGecko) when primary fails
3. Chrome storage cache from background script
4. Local storage cache in content script
5. Emergency fallback data with estimated price

## Enhancement Plan

1. **Complete the existing implementation**
   - Review and test all existing fallback mechanisms
   - Ensure proper documentation
   - Mark the task as completed in TODO-1-EXTENSION.md

2. **Add testing for fallback mechanisms**
   - Create unit tests for the fallback logic

## Verification
To verify this task is complete, I'll ensure:
- All fallback mechanisms are properly implemented and working
- The code is well-documented
- The TODO task is marked as completed
