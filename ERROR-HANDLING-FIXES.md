# Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines recent error handling enhancements to address specific issues with the Bitcoin Price Tag extension, particularly focusing on Amazon compatibility issues and iframe restrictions.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Messaging Bridge Availability

**Problem:** In certain contexts, the messaging bridge may be unavailable or partially initialized, causing `Bitcoin Price Tag Error [runtime][error]: Extension messaging bridge not available` errors.

**Solution:**

- Enhanced bridge availability checks to verify both existence and function availability
- Added proper fallback logic when bridge is unavailable
- Implemented emergency price data when normal retrieval fails

```javascript
// Improved check for bridge availability
const isBridgeAvailable =
  typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
  window.bitcoinPriceTagBridge &&
  typeof window.bitcoinPriceTagBridge.sendMessageToBackground === 'function';
```

### 2. Callback Function Errors

**Problem:** Multiple `Bitcoin Price Tag Error [unknown][warning]: callback is not a function` errors were appearing in the console, causing the extension to crash.

**Solution:**

- Added strict type checking for callbacks in bridge messages
- Implemented fallback empty callbacks when missing
- Added comprehensive try/catch blocks around callback execution
- Created recovery mechanisms to provide emergency price data

```javascript
// Type checking and fallback for callback
if (typeof callback !== 'function') {
  console.error('Bitcoin Price Tag: Callback is not a function in sendMessageToBackground');
  // Create a dummy callback to avoid errors
  callback = () => {};
}
```

### 3. Amazon Iframe Restrictions

**Problem:** Amazon uses restricted iframes for some content (particularly ads and widgets), causing the extension to crash when attempting to access DOM elements across iframe boundaries.

**Solution:**

- Added detection for cross-origin and restricted iframes
- Implemented checks for Amazon-specific iframe contexts
- Skip DOM scanning in restricted contexts to prevent errors
- Added additional error handling to prevent crashes in edge cases

```javascript
// Check if we're in a context where DOM access might be restricted
if (isInRestrictedIframe() || isAmazonRestrictedIframe()) {
  console.warn('Bitcoin Price Tag: Skipping DOM scanning in restricted iframe context');
  return;
}
```

## Error Recovery Strategy

The extension now implements a three-tier error recovery strategy:

1. **Primary Mechanism**: Attempt to use the standard messaging bridge and API
2. **Secondary Mechanism**: Fall back to cached data if primary fails
3. **Tertiary Mechanism**: Use emergency fallback data with a reasonable Bitcoin price estimate

This ensures that the extension continues to function even when encountering unexpected errors or restrictions.

## Benefits

- **Improved Stability**: The extension no longer crashes on Amazon pages
- **Enhanced Resilience**: Graceful degradation when encountering restricted environments
- **Better User Experience**: Error conditions are handled invisibly, allowing normal extension operation
- **Detailed Logging**: More comprehensive error logging to aid future debugging

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy for iframe contexts
- Consider implementing a read-only mode for restricted environments
- Add telemetry (with user consent) to better understand error patterns in production
