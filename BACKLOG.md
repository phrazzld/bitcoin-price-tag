## Critical Priority (Must Do First)

### üõë Migration & Immediate Requirements

- **[Refactor] Migrate Chrome Extension to Manifest V3**
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: URGENT - Required for continued compatibility and distribution on the Chrome Web Store. Google has set deadlines for Manifest V2 deprecation, making this time-sensitive.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `manifest.json` is updated to V3 schema, any background scripts are migrated to a Service Worker, and related API calls are updated. Extension functions correctly under V3.
  - **Dependencies**: Minimal TypeScript setup (can be done with a lightweight configuration first)
  - **Timeline Constraint**: Critical due to Chrome's deprecation timeline

- **[Enhancement] Minimal TypeScript Setup for V3 Migration**
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Provides just enough TypeScript infrastructure to support the V3 migration efficiently without overinvesting in tooling that might need adjustment post-migration.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Basic `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript installed, minimal build script configured, enough to compile TS files for the V3 migration.
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Note**: This is a streamlined version of the full tooling setup that will follow

- **[Refactor] [GORDIAN] Implement Service Worker Architecture for State & API Management**
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Directly tied to Manifest V3 migration as V3 requires service workers. Centralizes state (price data), API calls, and caching logic in the Service Worker, eliminating global state in content scripts.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Price fetching logic moves to the Service Worker. Content scripts request price data via message passing. Global variables are removed from content scripts.
  - **Dependencies**: Migrate Chrome Extension to Manifest V3
  - **Note**: This combines V3 migration with the Gordian approach to state management

## High Priority
