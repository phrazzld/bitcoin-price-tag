## Critical Priority (Must Do First)

### üõë Migration & Immediate Requirements

- **[Refactor] Migrate Chrome Extension to Manifest V3**
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: URGENT - Required for continued compatibility and distribution on the Chrome Web Store. Google has set deadlines for Manifest V2 deprecation, making this time-sensitive.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `manifest.json` is updated to V3 schema, any background scripts are migrated to a Service Worker, and related API calls are updated. Extension functions correctly under V3.
  - **Dependencies**: Minimal TypeScript setup (can be done with a lightweight configuration first)
  - **Timeline Constraint**: Critical due to Chrome's deprecation timeline

### üö® Critical Test Infrastructure Issues (From Code Review)

- **[Bug] Update Tests and Mocks to Use CoinGecko API Instead of CoinDesk**
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: CRITICAL - Tests are using CoinDesk API structures while production uses CoinGecko. This creates a false sense of security and could lead to undetected bugs.
  - **Expected Outcome**: All tests, mocks, and related documentation use the correct CoinGecko API URL and response format.
  - **Affected Files**: 
    - `src/service-worker/api.test.ts`
    - `tests/mocks/fetch.ts`
    - `README.md` (line 160)
    - `verify-build.js` (line 69)
    - `MANIFEST_V3_APPROACHES.md`
  
- **[Bug] Fix Manifest Host Permissions Check in Build Script**
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: BLOCKER - Build verification script checks for CoinDesk but manifest uses CoinGecko, causing false negatives.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `verify-build.js` correctly validates CoinGecko host permissions.
  - **Fix**: Change line 69 in `verify-build.js` from `*://api.coindesk.com/*` to `*://api.coingecko.com/*`

- **[Enhancement] Minimal TypeScript Setup for V3 Migration**
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Provides just enough TypeScript infrastructure to support the V3 migration efficiently without overinvesting in tooling that might need adjustment post-migration.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Basic `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript installed, minimal build script configured, enough to compile TS files for the V3 migration.
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Note**: This is a streamlined version of the full tooling setup that will follow

- **[Refactor] [GORDIAN] Implement Service Worker Architecture for State & API Management**
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Directly tied to Manifest V3 migration as V3 requires service workers. Centralizes state (price data), API calls, and caching logic in the Service Worker, eliminating global state in content scripts.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Price fetching logic moves to the Service Worker. Content scripts request price data via message passing. Global variables are removed from content scripts.
  - **Dependencies**: Migrate Chrome Extension to Manifest V3
  - **Note**: This combines V3 migration with the Gordian approach to state management

## High Priority

### üêõ Significant Issues from Code Review
