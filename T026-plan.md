# T026: Refactor Amazon DOM Processing for Resilience and Context Awareness

## Task Description
Refactor Amazon-specific DOM processing logic to make it more resilient and context-aware. Add defensive checks against unexpected DOM structures. Ensure complex or potentially error-prone DOM operations are skipped entirely when running in a restricted context detected by T021. Review WeakSet usage for correctness.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Analyze Current Implementation
- Review the current DOM processing in dom-scanner.js, focusing on Amazon-specific functions
- Identify areas where DOM manipulation could fail in restricted contexts
- Identify places where WeakSet usage needs to be improved
- Map out dependent functions and their error handling

### 2. Enhance Amazon-specific DOM Processing Functions
- Add comprehensive defensive checks in `processAmazonPrice`, `findAmazonPriceContainer`, and `extractAmazonPriceComponents`
- Implement early exit and safe fallbacks when DOM operations might be risky
- Ensure all DOM operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Add context awareness using the improved detection from T021

### 3. Improve WeakSet Usage for Processed Nodes
- Review current implementation of `processedNodes` WeakSet
- Add resilient creation and check mechanisms
- Ensure proper garbage collection by avoiding strong references
- Implement a safer reset mechanism

### 4. Add Robust Context-Aware Logic
- Integrate enhanced context detection to skip high-risk operations
- Use early exit patterns in functions that manipulate the DOM
- Implement tiered operation modes based on detected context restrictions
- Ensure DOM-heavy operations are skipped in Amazon restricted iframes

### 5. Improve Error Handling in DOM Operations
- Add detailed error logging for DOM manipulation issues
- Include context information in error objects
- Implement graceful degradation when operations fail
- Add operation retries with backoff for transient failures

### 6. Testing
- Verify changes don't break existing functionality
- Test with mock restricted contexts
- Verify proper WeakSet behavior
- Ensure context detection is properly integrated with DOM operations

## Expected Changes
- Enhanced defensive coding in Amazon-specific functions
- Improved context detection integration
- Better WeakSet management
- More resilient DOM processing with proper fallbacks
