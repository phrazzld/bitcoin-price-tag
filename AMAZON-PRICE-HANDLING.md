# Amazon Price Handling Improvements

## Overview

The Bitcoin Price Tag extension now includes enhanced handling for Amazon's complex price structures. Amazon uses a unique DOM layout for prices, splitting them into multiple components (currency symbol, whole number part, and fraction part), which previously caused issues with our price conversion logic.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Holistic Price Container Approach

Instead of modifying individual price components (which led to malformed prices), we now:

- Identify the containing element for the entire price structure
- Extract all components without modifying the originals
- Create a complete, properly formatted price combining all elements
- Apply the Bitcoin conversion to the complete price

### 2. Enhanced Container Detection

We've improved the `findAmazonPriceContainer` function to detect various Amazon price container formats:

- Standard Amazon price containers (`.a-price`, `.sx-price`)
- Text-based price formats (`.a-text-price`)
- Price range containers (`.a-price-range`)
- Offscreen accessibility prices (`.a-offscreen`)
- Deal and special pricing containers

### 3. Robust Component Extraction

The `extractAmazonPriceComponents` function now handles diverse price formats:

- Attempts to extract structured components first (using class names)
- Falls back to text content parsing if structured extraction fails
- Uses regex-based extraction for complex or non-standard formats
- Handles edge cases like missing decimal parts or currency symbols

### 4. Visual Improvements

We've added CSS styles to enhance the appearance of converted prices:

- Bitcoin prices display in Bitcoin orange color (#f7931a)
- Hover effects for better visibility
- Tooltips for price data freshness
- Status indicators for stale price data
- Proper spacing and layout to avoid disrupting the page

### 5. Metadata & Performance Optimization

We've added various optimizations:

- Marking processed elements with data attributes to avoid duplicate processing
- Creating a new DOM element instead of modifying the original
- Maintaining layout by hiding original prices instead of removing them
- Smart caching of conversion functions and price data
- Bridge interface for exposing utilities to the page context

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Price Representation**: Prices maintain their proper format (currency symbol, decimal points, etc.)
2. **Consistent User Experience**: Amazon prices follow the same conversion pattern as other sites
3. **Performance Improvements**: Fewer DOM operations and better component caching
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between detection, extraction, and rendering logic

## Example

### Before

A price like "$19.99" would be incorrectly processed as separate components:

- Currency symbol removed: "19."
- Decimal part removed
- Result: Malformed "19." without Bitcoin conversion

### After

The same "$19.99" price is now:

- Identified as a complete price unit
- Extracted fully as "$19.99"
- Converted properly to Bitcoin
- Displayed as "$19.99 (39,980 sats)"
