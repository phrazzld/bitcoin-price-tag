## Chosen Approach
Refactor service-worker/index.ts to extract testable functions and implement unit tests mocking only Chrome APIs to achieve isolated, high-coverage testing.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity:** This approach maintains a straightforward structure by focusing on minimal refactoring for testability, adhering to the philosophy's emphasis on simplicity first while avoiding unnecessary complexity from deep mocking needs.
- **Modularity and Strict Separation:** Refactoring promotes better modularity by clearly separating concerns, aligning with the strict separation principle, but only where needed, trading off minimal initial changes against enhanced long-term isolation of external dependencies.
- **Testability:** It ensures minimal mocking by refactoring code to make handlers testable without internal mocks, directly addressing the philosophy's testability hierarchy and avoiding violations of the no-internal-mocking rule, with the trade-off of slight upfront effort for reliable isolation.
- **Coding Standards:** Refactoring complies with mandatory standards like immutability and pure functions, providing deeper green in coding standards by improving maintainability without introducing over-engineering, as opposed to weak options that might skirt these rules.
- **Documentation Approach:** Tests include self-documenting code and TSDoc comments, fully aligning with the documentation philosophy's focus on rationale, offering a trade-off of integrated documentation over separate files for better adherence to the hierarchy.

## Build Steps
1. Analyze service-worker/index.ts to identify event handlers (e.g., for messages and alarms) and extract any impure functions relying on internal modules (cache.ts, api.ts) into pure, testable utilities if coupled with external dependencies.
2. Refactor handlers to accept Chrome API dependencies (e.g., chrome.runtime, chrome.alarms) as injectable parameters or via a wrapper interface, ensuring no changes to internal module interactions.
3. Set up Jest or Vitest with ts-mockito or sinon to mock only Chrome APIs, verifying handler behavior by simulating events and asserting function calls to internal modules.
4. Write test cases for each handler, covering happy paths, edge cases, and errors, ensuring >80% coverage via tools like Istanbul, while adhering to FIRST principles (e.g., independent tests with clear assertions).
5. Integrate tests into CI/CD, run them against refactored code, and add TSDoc comments in tests to document rationale for scenarios, confirming no internal mocking and achieving verification as per the task.
