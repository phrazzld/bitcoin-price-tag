## Chosen Approach
Implement a comprehensive unit testing strategy for service-worker/index.ts handlers using Jest, with strict adherence to the no-mocking policy for internal collaborators, full Chrome API mocking, and detailed test cases for all event handlers to achieve >80% coverage.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity:** This approach focuses on straightforward test setup using Jest, avoiding complex mocking frameworks for internal modules, aligning with the philosophy of minimizing accidental complexity.
- **Modularity + Strict Separation:** By isolating external Chrome API dependencies through mocks while preserving real interactions with internal modules (cache.ts, api.ts), the approach respects strict separation of concerns and enforces clear boundaries.
- **Testability:** Adhering to the no-mocking policy for internal collaborators ensures tests reflect real behavior, enhancing reliability, while mocking only external Chrome APIs maintains test isolation as per the philosophy.
- **Coding Standards:** The strategy leverages TypeScript's strict typing and Jest's built-in capabilities, ensuring compliance with language-specific standards and avoiding suppressed warnings or type ignores.
- **Documentation Approach:** Test cases will serve as executable documentation, focusing on the 'what' of handler behavior, with clear naming and structure to explain intent, aligning with the self-documenting code principle.

## Build Steps
1. **Setup Test Environment:** Configure Jest for TypeScript in the project, ensuring `ts-jest` is installed and a `jest.config.js` is set up to handle service worker files with appropriate module resolution and environment (e.g., `jsdom` or custom setup for service worker context).
2. **Mock Chrome APIs:** Create a mock implementation for `chrome.runtime` and `chrome.alarms` in a dedicated `__mocks__/chrome.ts` file, providing stubbed methods for `sendMessage`, `onMessage`, `createAlarm`, etc., to simulate external behavior without real API calls.
3. **Organize Test Structure:** Create a test file `service-worker/index.test.ts` adjacent to `index.ts`, organizing tests by event handler (e.g., `install`, `activate`, `message`, `alarm`) with subtests for different scenarios using Jest's `describe` and `test` blocks.
4. **Implement Test Cases for Event Handlers:** Write specific tests for each handler, covering happy paths (e.g., successful cache initialization on install), error paths (e.g., cache failure), and edge cases (e.g., invalid message formats), verifying function calls and side effects without mocking `cache.ts` or `api.ts`.
5. **Ensure Coverage Goals:** Use Jest's coverage tool (`--coverage`) to measure line/branch coverage, iteratively adding test cases for untested branches or conditions in handlers until >80% coverage is achieved, focusing on public API behavior.
6. **Verify Behavior with FIRST Principles:** Ensure tests are Fast (isolated setup), Independent (no shared state), Repeatable (consistent results), Self-Validating (clear assertions), and Timely (written alongside code), running them in CI to catch regressions.
7. **Refactor for Testability if Needed:** If handlers are difficult to test due to tight coupling or side effects, refactor `index.ts` to improve separation (e.g., extract logic into pure functions or injectable dependencies) while maintaining no internal mocking.
8. **Integrate with CI Pipeline:** Add test execution and coverage checks to the CI workflow, enforcing pass criteria and coverage thresholds (>80%) to prevent merges unless standards are met, aligning with automation principles.
