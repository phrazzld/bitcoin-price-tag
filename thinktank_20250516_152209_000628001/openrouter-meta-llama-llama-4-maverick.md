## Chosen Approach
Implement a comprehensive testing strategy for service-worker/index.ts handlers using Jest and mocking Chrome APIs.

## Rationale
- The testing philosophy requires minimal mocking, focusing on external dependencies like Chrome APIs.
- Internal collaborators (cache.ts, api.ts) should not be mocked.
- Test structure should follow the FIRST principles.
- Achieving >80% code coverage is mandatory.

## Build Steps
1. Set up Jest with TypeScript support for testing.
2. Create mock implementations for Chrome APIs (chrome.runtime, chrome.alarms) using Jest's mocking capabilities.
3. Write unit tests for each event handler in service-worker/index.ts, verifying correct function calls based on messages and alarms.
4. Ensure tests are independent, isolated, and self-validating.
5. Measure and verify >80% code coverage.
6. Integrate tests into the CI pipeline to enforce coverage thresholds and prevent regressions.
