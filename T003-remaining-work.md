# T003 Remaining Work: Complete Type-Safe Test Builders Implementation

**Status:** Infrastructure complete, pattern proven. Remaining work is systematic application.

## Work Completed

### Infrastructure Created
1. ✅ Created `tests/utils/chrome-api-builders.ts` with typed Chrome API mocks
2. ✅ Created `tests/utils/dom-builders.ts` with typed DOM/MutationObserver builders
3. ✅ Created `tests/utils/fetch-builders.ts` with typed fetch mocks
4. ✅ Established `satisfies` operator pattern for type safety
5. ✅ Started refactoring `dom-observer.test.ts` (fixed 3 instances, 31 remain)

### Key Achievements
- Eliminated `as any` casts while maintaining full type inference
- Tests pass with typed builders
- TypeScript strict mode compilation succeeds
- Pattern established and proven to work

## Remaining Work

### Files to Update (53 suppressions remaining)

#### dom-observer.test.ts (31 suppressions)
- Pattern established, need systematic replacement
- Focus on NodeList creation patterns
- MutationObserver mock patterns

#### Service Worker Tests (12 suppressions)
- `src/service-worker/index.test.ts` - Update Chrome & fetch mocks
- `src/service-worker/cache.test.ts` - Update Chrome & fetch mocks  
- `src/service-worker/cache-success.test.ts` - Update Chrome mocks

#### Integration Tests (8 suppressions)
- `tests/integration/messaging.integration.test.ts` - Update harness usage
- `tests/integration/messaging-simple.test.ts` - Update Chrome mocks
- `tests/integration/service-worker-persistence.test.ts` - Update test data

#### Playwright Tests (2 suppressions)
- `tests/playwright/specs/edge-cases.test.ts` - Fix circular reference
- `tests/playwright/helpers/service-worker.ts` - Update global setup

### Common Patterns to Replace

1. **Chrome API Setup**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   global.chrome = mockChrome as any;
   
   // After:
   import { createMockChrome } from '../../tests/utils/chrome-api-builders';
   global.chrome = createMockChrome();
   ```

2. **NodeList Creation**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   } as any;
   
   // After:
   import { createMockNodeList } from '../../tests/utils/dom-builders';
   const nodeList = createMockNodeList(nodes);
   ```

3. **Fetch Mocking**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   global.fetch = mockFetch as any;
   
   // After:
   import { createMockFetch } from '../../tests/utils/fetch-builders';
   global.fetch = createMockFetch();
   ```

### Verification Steps
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit --strict` after each file update
2. Run tests for each updated file
3. Ensure no `as any` remains in test code
4. Verify full type inference (no explicit type annotations needed)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Zero `as any` in all test files
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Full type inference throughout
- ✅ Reusable builders across all test files

## Next Steps
1. Complete dom-observer.test.ts refactoring (highest priority due to 31 suppressions)
2. Update service-worker test files using chrome-api-builders
3. Update integration tests
4. Clean up remaining files

The infrastructure is in place and proven. The remaining work is systematic application of the established patterns.
