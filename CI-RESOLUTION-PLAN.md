# CI Resolution Plan

**Failure Reference:** CI-FAILURE-SUMMARY.md  
**Target:** Fix all CI pipeline failures and establish robust quality gates  
**Priority:** BLOCKER - Immediate resolution required  

## Resolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Configuration Fix (IMMEDIATE)
**Goal:** Resolve primary package manager configuration mismatch

#### 1.1 GitHub Actions Workflow Update
**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Changes Required:**

```yaml
# BEFORE (causing failure):
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'  # ❌ WRONG

# AFTER (correct configuration):
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'pnpm'  # ✅ CORRECT

# ALSO ADD pnpm installation step:
- name: Install pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
  with:
    version: 10.10.0  # Match package.json declaration
```

#### 1.2 Verify Package Manager Consistency
**Files:** `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`  
**Validation:**
- Confirm `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.10.0"` in package.json
- Ensure pnpm-lock.yaml is current and committed
- Verify no package-lock.json exists (npm remnant)

### Phase 2: Secondary Issue Discovery (IMMEDIATE AFTER PHASE 1)
**Goal:** Identify and resolve issues masked by primary failure

#### 2.1 Run CI Pipeline Test
- Trigger CI run after Phase 1 completion
- Monitor for secondary failures that were previously masked

#### 2.2 Expected Secondary Issues Assessment
Based on recent development activity, potential issues may include:
- ESLint configuration errors (already partially resolved)
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Test execution failures
- Coverage threshold violations
- Build process issues

### Phase 3: Quality Gate Validation (FOLLOW-UP)
**Goal:** Ensure all quality gates function as designed

#### 3.1 Coverage Threshold Validation
- Verify vitest coverage thresholds are realistic
- Confirm codecov.yml integration works correctly
- Test coverage PR blocking functionality

#### 3.2 Commit Hook Validation
- Test conventional commit enforcement
- Verify pre-commit hooks function correctly
- Ensure commit-msg hook integration works

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes
- GitHub Actions cache configuration change
- pnpm installation step addition
- These are configuration-only changes with no code impact

### Medium Risk Areas
- Secondary failures may reveal code quality issues requiring fixes
- Coverage thresholds may need adjustment if unrealistic
- TypeScript configuration may need refinement

### High Risk Areas  
- None identified - primary issue is pure configuration mismatch

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Indicators
✅ CI pipeline initiates without "Dependencies lock file not found" error  
✅ pnpm installation succeeds in CI environment  
✅ All CI jobs progress beyond dependency resolution  

### Phase 2 Success Indicators
✅ All 5 primary CI jobs complete successfully (lint, typecheck, test, coverage, build)  
✅ No blocking quality gate failures  
✅ Coverage thresholds pass or require documented adjustment  

### Phase 3 Success Indicators
✅ Full CI pipeline runs successfully on PR  
✅ Commit hooks enforce quality standards locally  
✅ Quality gates block problematic code from merging  

## Implementation Timeline

**Immediate (0-15 minutes):**
- Fix GitHub Actions workflow configuration  
- Verify package manager consistency  
- Trigger test CI run  

**Short-term (15-60 minutes):**
- Resolve any secondary failures discovered  
- Adjust configurations as needed  
- Validate end-to-end quality pipeline  

**Validation (Ongoing):**
- Monitor CI stability over next few commits  
- Ensure quality gates function as designed  

## Rollback Plan

**If Phase 1 fails:**
- Revert `.github/workflows/ci.yml` changes
- Original configuration will restore previous failure state
- No worse outcome than current state

**If Phase 2 reveals major issues:**
- Address issues incrementally rather than rolling back
- Use feature flags or conditional CI execution if needed
- Maintain forward progress on quality infrastructure

## Documentation Updates Required

**After successful resolution:**
- Update README.md if CI badge reflects new state
- Document any configuration changes in CLAUDE.md if needed
- Update development documentation with resolved CI pipeline details

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

- GitHub repository write access (to update workflow)
- pnpm 10.10.0 availability in CI environment (should be automatic)  
- No code changes required for Phase 1
- Existing package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml must be valid
