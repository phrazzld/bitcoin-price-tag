# TODO Index

This project's tasks have been split into multiple focused files for easier implementation and review.

## Execution Order (Numbered by Priority)

1. [TODO-1-EXTENSION.md](TODO-1-EXTENSION.md) - Manifest V3 migration, error handling, performance
2. [TODO-2-INFRASTRUCTURE.md](TODO-2-INFRASTRUCTURE.md) - CI setup, git hooks, quality standards
3. [TODO-3-DOCUMENTATION.md](TODO-3-DOCUMENTATION.md) - README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING

## Completed Tasks

- [x] [TODO-AMAZON-CRASH.md](TODO-AMAZON-CRASH.md) - Amazon crash bug fixes completed

## Implementation Strategy

Each TODO file represents a logical group of tasks that can be implemented as a separate pull request. The numbered filenames indicate the recommended order of implementation.

This approach offers several benefits:

- Focused changes that are easier to review
- Reduced deployment risk
- Ability to work incrementally
- Smaller, more manageable PRs

The original comprehensive task list is preserved in [TODO-ORIGINAL.md](TODO-ORIGINAL.md) for reference.
