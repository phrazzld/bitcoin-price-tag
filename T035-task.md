## Title: add structured logging to service worker modules

## Original Ticket Text:
- [ ] **T035 · Chore · P2: add structured logging to service worker modules**
    - **Context:** Logging & Observability - Log Events & Structured Fields (Service Worker)
    - **Action:**
        1. Import and use the logging utility (or `console` directly if T034 is deferred) in `src/service-worker/index.ts`, `cache.ts`, `api.ts`.
        2. Add log statements for specified events with structured fields.
    - **Done-when:**
        1. Service worker logs key events with relevant data as per plan.
    - **Verification:**
        1. Run extension and check console output.
    - **Depends-on:** [T014, T015, T016, T034]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

I need to add structured logging to the service worker modules of the Bitcoin Price Tag Chrome extension. The task requires:

1. Import the newly created logger utility (from T034) into three service worker modules
2. Add appropriate log statements at key points in each module
3. Ensure logging follows the development philosophy guidelines

Key Considerations:
- DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md logging requirements:
  - Entry/exit of key functions
  - External API calls (before/after)
  - Decision points
  - State changes
  - Error handling
  - Background jobs
  - Context propagation (correlation IDs)
  
- Chrome Extension specific requirements:
  - Service worker lifecycle events
  - Alarm handling
  - Message passing
  - Cache operations
  - API fetching

Questions to address:
1. What are the key logging points in each module?
2. How should we handle correlation IDs in a Chrome extension context?
3. What log levels should be used for different events?
4. How to structure the log data for maximum observability?
5. How to test the logging implementation?

Context needed:
- Current implementation of service worker modules
- Logger utility API from T034
- Chrome extension messaging patterns
- Service worker lifecycle
- Development philosophy logging guidelines

Please provide a comprehensive implementation plan that:
1. Identifies all key logging points for each module
2. Specifies appropriate log levels
3. Defines structured data for each log entry
4. Handles correlation/request IDs appropriately
5. Follows TypeScript best practices
6. Ensures no sensitive data is logged
