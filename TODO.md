## Immediate Priority (BLOCKER)


### T027 - Resolve CI Secondary Failures
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimate:** 30-60 minutes  
**Dependencies:** T026  
**Context:** CI-RESOLUTION-PLAN.md Phase 2  

**Description:**
After fixing the primary package manager configuration, resolve any secondary failures that become visible (lint errors, type errors, test failures, build issues).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 5 CI jobs complete successfully: lint, typecheck, test, coverage, build
- [ ] No ESLint errors blocking pipeline
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage thresholds are met or documented for adjustment
- [ ] Build process completes without errors

**Notes:**
- Secondary issues are currently masked by primary configuration failure
- May require code fixes, configuration adjustments, or threshold tuning
- Track specific issues discovered in sub-tasks as needed

### T028 - Validate CI Quality Gates End-to-End
**Status:** BLOCKED (T027)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimate:** 30 minutes  
**Dependencies:** T027  
**Context:** CI-RESOLUTION-PLAN.md Phase 3  

**Description:**
Validate that the complete CI quality pipeline functions as designed, including commit hooks, PR blocking, and coverage enforcement.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Conventional commit enforcement works locally via commit-msg hook
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully on PR creation/updates
- [ ] Coverage gates block PRs below thresholds (test with dummy change)
- [ ] All quality standards are enforced before merge
- [ ] CI badges in README.md reflect accurate status

**Test Plan:**
1. Test commit-msg hook with invalid conventional commit format
2. Create test PR to verify CI execution
3. Temporarily lower coverage to test blocking behavior
4. Verify PR cannot merge with failing CI
