- **Files**:
  - `tests/harness/ChromeRuntimeHarness.ts`
  - All test files using Chrome API mocks
- **Issues**:
  - Inconsistent Chrome API implementations across tests
  - Storage API mock behavior varies between test files
  - Runtime message handling patterns not standardized
  - Mock factory patterns need unification
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Centralized Chrome API mock factory implemented
  - [x] Consistent storage API behavior across all tests
  - [x] Standardized message handling with proper sendResponse
  - [x] Mock configuration shared across test suites

### T042: Implement Comprehensive Test Cleanup Infrastructure
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Enhance test isolation and cleanup to prevent cross-contamination
- **Files**: All test files, `tests/utils/test-lifecycle.ts`
- **Issues**:
  - State persistence between test executions
  - Timer cleanup incomplete between tests
  - Global mock state not properly reset
  - Test execution order dependencies
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Comprehensive beforeEach/afterEach cleanup in all files
  - [x] Timer state completely reset between tests
  - [x] Global mock state isolation implemented
  - [x] Tests pass in any execution order

### T043: Fix Playwright End-to-End Test Stability  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed (with follow-up ESLint tasks)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Resolve basic extension functionality and lifecycle E2E test failures
- **Files**:
  - `tests/playwright/specs/basic.test.ts` (‚úÖ updated to working fixture)
  - `tests/playwright/specs/lifecycle.test.ts` (‚è≥ needs migration)
- **Key Achievements**:
  - ‚úÖ Created `extension-final.ts` fixture with reliable test infrastructure
  - ‚úÖ Implemented manual content script injection for Playwright testing  
  - ‚úÖ Extension functionality fully validated (price annotation works)
  - ‚úÖ Service worker communication proven functional
  - ‚úÖ 11 tests now passing with reliable infrastructure
- **Root Cause**: Content scripts don't auto-inject in Playwright, service worker events unreliable

### T044: Fix ESLint Issues in Playwright Test Files  
- **Status**: üîÑ Pending
- **Priority**: Low  
- **Description**: Resolve linting errors in newly created Playwright test fixtures
- **Files**:
  - `tests/playwright/fixtures/extension-final.ts` (3 errors, 3 warnings)
  - `tests/playwright/specs/final-working.test.ts` (1 error)  
  - `tests/playwright/specs/manual-injection-test.test.ts` (4 warnings)
- **Issues**: Empty object pattern, unused variables, any types
- **Notes**: Non-blocking since functionality works correctly

### T045: Migrate Legacy Playwright Tests to Working Infrastructure
- **Status**: üîÑ Pending
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Update remaining 20 failing tests to use extension-final.ts fixture
- **Impact**: Currently 11 tests pass, 20 fail due to old broken fixtures
- **Files**: All tests using `tests/playwright/fixtures/extension.ts`
- **Issues**:
  - Extension loading reliability in CI environment
  - Service worker persistence validation
  - DOM interaction timing issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Extension loads consistently in Playwright
  - [ ] Basic price annotation functionality works
  - [ ] Service worker lifecycle tests execute reliably
  - [ ] DOM interaction patterns work in CI environment

## Completed Tasks

### T034: Fix Service Worker Test Infrastructure CI Compatibility ‚úÖ
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Implemented async expectLogToContain helper with CI-aware waiting mechanism, fallback verification using Chrome API mocks, and comprehensive test cleanup for CI timing compatibility

### T035: Optimize Integration Test Chrome Runtime Harness for CI ‚úÖ  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Fixed integration test timeout failures, implemented CI-specific timeout configuration (15s vs 10s), improved Chrome runtime mock response timing with setImmediate(), added test retry mechanisms, and resolved targeted failing tests

### T036: Improve API Error Test Isolation and Cleanup ‚úÖ
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
- **Description**: Enhanced async cleanup in cleanupApiTest() function, improved test isolation with comprehensive mock cleanup, eliminated error test cross-contamination (16/16 api-error.test.ts passing), and prevented ApiError exceptions from bleeding into other test execution

### T037: Validate Complete CI Test Infrastructure Resolution ‚úÖ
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Validation shows targeted improvements successful but broader infrastructure issues remain. Results: Error tests 100% passing ‚úÖ, Service worker 68% passing, Integration tests 23% passing, API retry 64% passing. T034-T036 delivered scope-specific improvements; additional infrastructure work needed for complete CI success.
